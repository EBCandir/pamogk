PAMOGK
=====

# Installation

## Getting the Code Base
You can either checkout the code base through git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tastanlab/pamogk.git
```
or you can download the master branch from:
> https://github.com/tastanlab/pamogk/archive/master.zip

## Python Environment
Project mainly uses python, but some of the plot generation codes use matlab or output html files (plotly.js). Also some libraries might be dependent on operating system. In our tests we used Debian 12.04LTS and macOS Catalina.

The cleanest way to start installation is first setting up a virtual environment of your choice. Some suggestions:

* [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html)
* [virtualenv/venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

`virtualenvwrapper` is basically wrapper for a cleaner `venv` experience.

## Setting up MOSEK
We are using [MOSEK Optimizer API](https://docs.mosek.com/9.1/pythonapi/index.html) for optimizing view weights, and in order to use MOSEK you will need a license file. MOSEK provides free certificates for academic purposes and free trial certificates for Commercial usages. You can see check the link below for information on how to acquire an academic license:

> https://www.mosek.com/products/academic-licenses/

### License File Placement
You can either place the license file under user's home directory in a folder named `mosek` e.g:
```bash
$HOME/mosek/mosec.lic # *nix/macOS users
%USERPROFILE%\mosek\mosek.lic # windows users
```

Other option is to set the `MOSEKLM_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable to your license file location.

## Dependencies
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**NOTE:** If you are not using a virtual environment we suggest adding `--user` option to the installation command so you won't be polluting the global package space.

## Required Environment Variables
First project root must be added to the python path. For *nix/macOS systems replace `$PROJECT_ROOT` with the full path of project folder that you checked out:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PROJECT_ROOT
```
Also please don't forget to export `MOSEKLM_LICENSE_FILE` variable as well if you are using a path other than `$HOME/mosek/mosek.lic`:
```bash
export MOSEKLM_LICENSE_FILE=$MY_MOSEK_LICENSE_FILE_PATH
```

# Folder Structure
* **data:** Data files that are both raw or generated by the project. Keeping intermediate files saves a lot of computation time where applicable.
* **kernels:** Kernel methods to calculate distance between patients. Will try to extend these!
* **data_processor:** Data processors/converters used to convert different forms of data to usable forms. Will try to extend these!
* **gene_mapper:** Uniprot/Entrez gene mapping matcher for different datasets using different gene IDs. Will try to separate to its own package or along with other tools.
* **pathway_reader:** https://.ndexbio.org CX format, and http://kegg.jp KGML format reader and converters. Will try to separate to its own package or along with other tools.
* **experiments:** Experiments done on real data.

# Running Experiments
Experiments are code entry points that have arguments that change per experiment. You can see their arguments by running them with `--help` parameter. e.g:
```bash
./experiments/pamogk_exp_1.py --help
```
and you should see help as such:
```
usage: pamogk_exp_1.py [-h] [--patient-data file-path] [--disable-cache]
                       [--run-id run-id]

Run PAMOGK algorithms on pathways

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --patient-data file-path, -f file-path
                        Patient data file (if relative searched under data
                        folder)
  --disable-cache, -c   disables intermediate caches
  --run-id run-id, -r run-id
                        Run ID
```
